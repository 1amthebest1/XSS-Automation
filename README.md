WOULD WORK FOR REFLECTED ONLY, I HAVE NOT IMPLEMENTED NOR TESTED THE PERSISTENT

USAGE :

python3 xss_script.py "https://(target)" xss_payloads.txt reflected (parameter) get url
python3 xss_script.py "https://(target)" xss_payloads.txt reflected (parameter) get html
python3 xss_script.py "https://(target)" xss_payloads.txt reflected (parameter) get base64

https://github.com/EmperialX/XSS-Automation-Tool

Look out for false positives 

This is just improved version of /EmperialX/XSS-Automation-Tool , updated to python3, and more 

Is great for reflected though, stored XSS, is different to test as often times it can be blind, feel free to implement it, and give a pull request
